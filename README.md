# Network Security & Infrastructure Portfolio  
**Author:** Abel Kolawole

This repository contains hands-on labs and independently documented projects focused on **network security**, **protocol analysis**, **Linux systems**, and **foundational infrastructure concepts**.  
The work here reflects practical learning through labs, troubleshooting, and technical documentation rather than coursework submissions.

## 👋 About Me

I am an early-career IT and networking professional with hands-on experience in **network infrastructure**, **Linux systems**, and **cybersecurity fundamentals**. My current focus is building strong foundations in networking and security through practical labs, packet analysis, incident investigation, and clear technical documentation.

I am actively preparing for the **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** and **Cisco CyberOps Fundamentals** certifications, and I use this portfolio to document my hands-on learning as I progress.

I am interested in roles related to **Network Engineering**, **SOC / Blue Team operations**, and **infrastructure support**, with a long-term goal of transitioning into **DevOps and cloud engineering**. I believe a solid understanding of networking, systems, security monitoring, and automation is critical to building reliable and scalable infrastructure.

### 🌐 TCP & UDP Protocol Analysis (Wireshark)
Independent network traffic analysis project examining **transport-layer behavior** using real packet captures.  
This project focuses on understanding how TCP and UDP differ in reliability, sequencing, and communication models.

**Key highlights:**
- Captured and analyzed FTP (TCP) and TFTP (UDP) traffic using Wireshark
- Identified TCP three-way handshake, sequencing, acknowledgments, and header fields
- Analyzed UDP packet structure, checksum behavior, and connectionless communication
- Compared reliability and performance trade-offs between TCP and UDP
- Troubleshot Linux permission issues related to root-owned packet captures
- Produced a formal technical report with diagrams, tables, and packet evidence

### 🔐 Security Incident Investigation (Incident Response)
This project documents a simulated **network security incident investigation** involving unauthorized command execution, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.

The investigation focuses on applying **incident response workflows**, **5-tuple traffic analysis**, and **packet inspection** to reconstruct attacker activity and determine impact.

**Key focus areas:**
- Network Security Monitoring (NSM)
- Incident detection and triage
- 5-tuple traffic analysis
- Packet inspection and protocol analysis
- Log correlation and evidence handling
