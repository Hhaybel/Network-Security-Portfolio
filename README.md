# Network Traffic Analysis: TCP vs. UDP

**Author:** Abel Kolawole  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Environment:** Cisco CyberOps Workstation (Ubuntu Linux)

## Project Overview
This project explores the fundamental differences between the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Using a simulated network environment in Mininet, I generated and captured FTP and TFTP traffic to analyze header structures, reliability mechanisms, and connection states.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Identify TCP header fields including the Three-Way Handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
- Inspect UDP header fields and observe connectionless data transfer.
- Troubleshoot Linux-based permission issues and file management within a VM.
- Analyze protocol behavior using Wireshark filters and packet inspection.

## Repository Structure
- `/analysis_report/`: Contains the final PDF report and high-resolution screenshots.
- `/captures/`: Includes raw `.pcapng` files for verification and further study.
